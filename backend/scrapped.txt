# Diet Chart For Fever Patients

Last Updated: Aug 11, 2020

## About

When someone has the fever, the rate of burning calories increases with the
increase in temperature. The body needs more calories to function properly in
fever than it requires in an ordinary situation. Diet plan in fever is crucial
for the immune system to function properly. Since more calories are burnt by
the body in fever, one must have nutrient dense food to give energy to the
immune system to function properly. Studies have found that a low-calorie diet
in fever worsens symptoms and lengthens the duration of sickness.

The list of foods items listed below is beneficial for reducing fever:

  1. Fluid-rich foods: Drink water, hot tea, fresh fruit juice. Intake of fluid-rich foods is recommended such as poultry broths, thin soups, coconut water. 
  2. Fresh fruits: Fruits like apples, oranges, watermelon, pineapple, kiwi are rich in vitamin C. This contains antioxidants that reduce fever. 
  3. Avoid fruits with heavy sugar and fruits canned in syrup because sugar inhibits the immune system. The banana provides vital nutrients and easy to digest. 
  4. Proper intake of proteins: Scrambled eggs, smoothie with low-fat milk, dal, chana or Indian cottage cheese are rich in protein and beneficial.

  3. Only eat peeled fruits and vegetables. 
  4. Make sure your drinking water is boiled or treated. 
  5. Clean water can become contaminated again if it is not stored safely. So make sure to store the drinking water in a clean container with a small opening or a cover. Use it within 4 hours. 
  6. Drink more water( Min 6-8 glass) 
  7. Drink boiled and properly filtered water 
  8. Include good quality proteins(eggs, meat paste, fish, poultry) in properly cooked form.

Dont\'s:

  1. Typhoid is quite common in areas with poor hygiene, so avoid roadside stalls. 
  2. Avoid handling food or any other household things if there is a risk of spreading the disease. 
  3. Don\'t go for heavy meals, split your heavy meals and do frequent small meals. 
  4. Avoid high fiber foods.

An abrupt increase in body temperature is called a fever. It’s one element of
the immune system’s total reaction. An infection is typically the cause of a
fever.

### **Cause of a fever**

The hypothalamus can raise body temperature in response to illness or immune
system responses. This sets off intricate mechanisms that increase heat
production and limit heat loss. The body generates heat in a few different
ways, one of which is shivering. Your body retains heat when you cover up in a
covering because you’re feeling chilly.

The most common hypothalamus-related causes that increases the body
temperature, resulting in the body to experience a fever are:

  * Infections caused by various types of bacteria or viruses
  * Heat exhaustion.
  * Joint inflammation
  * Treatments for cancer and cancer
  * Hormonal imbalance
  * Some side effects of medicines.

Certain issues are connected to the high-grade fever. This includes strokes,
seizures or organ damages. If, in addition, the body’s temperature is over the
normal range between 97degF to 99degF .

## **Importance of _Diet in Fever_**

There is an importance of diet change with the help of a professional
dietitian about food to during fever and this could be understood more with
the knowledge of an impact of fever on nutritional status.

Whatever the reason, the body undergoes many metabolic alterations as its
temperature rises above normal. The degree of body temperature increase and
the length of the fever are directly correlated with these dietary status
changes. Fever causes the following modifications to a person’s nutritional
and metabolic condition.

  * The basal metabolic rate (BMR) rises with an increase in body temperature.
  * Fever causes the depletion of adipose and glycogen tissue reserves since it is linked to both anorexia and higher energy expenditure brought on by elevated BMR.
  * The basal metabolic rate rises with an increase in body temperature.
  * Tissue/muscle proteins are broken down as backup energy sources when there is a sustained negative energy balance.
  * Dehydration risk escalates as a result of fever-related perspiration and increased urine production.
  * Higher levels of perspiration, urine, and occasionally vomiting and diarrhea result in increased losses of several electrolytes, including chloride, potassium, and sodium.
  * There is insufficient intake and absorption of nutrients, which raises the risk of deficiency disorders developing.
  * Depletion of macro- and micronutrient reserves leads to weight loss and heightened vulnerability to subsequent infections.
  * Elevated body temperature in the initial trimester of gestation may result in congenital abnormalities, including anencephaly.
  * Moreover, fever raises the need for insulin and modifies the metabolism and clearance of medications used to treat the various illnesses linked to fever.

Thus, fevers can significantly affect nutritional status and metabolism, so
one needs the professional consent on diet change from Dt. Rukhsana Azhar from
Diet4U Wellness.

How a fever kills appetite?

The ability of a high temperature or cold to suppress appetite is well known.
If you are in contact with a dietitian then you need not to worry too much, if
you’re just unable to eat your regular meals for several days. Just remember
to stay hydrated as much as possible. Dietitian will guide you foods to eat
during a fever and foods to avoid during fever.

Most people do not live in nutritional danger. If we get a little numb for a
few days, we have plenty of supplies. Try as you might, though, and make sure
you continue to consume fluids.

### **Non-Vegan _foods_ to eat in _Fever_**

Speaking of protein, when you have a fever, your body requires as much of it
as possible. The appropriate kind of protein, though, is essential. It’s not
worth worrying about your system burning extra calories because fish and
poultry are excellent suppliers of protein and are readily digested.

Chicken Soup- Chicken soup is the best food to eat during fever. Chicken soup
made with various spices, as well as celery leaf, spring onions are bursting
with flavor that aid in increasing the appetite. They are also simple to
digest in your stomach. It is a healthy food for fever which is extremely high
in protein and various kinds of minerals and vitamins.

### **_Foods_****to avoid during _Fever_ **

Drinks with caffeine: Your body sheds fluids when you have a fever because of
the high temperature. When you’re experiencing a fever, caffeine-containing
beverages like coffee and tea are diuretics, which exacerbate symptoms and
cause dehydration.

Alcohol: Drinking alcohol might lead to dehydration and upset stomach.
Moreover, it may weaken the immunological system. Alcohol is strictly avoid in
fever diet.

Sugary Foods: Steer clear of foods high in sugar and artificial sweeteners if
you’re sick with a fever. These foods are difficult for the stomach to
process. Furthermore, too much sugar can aggravate inflammation, which could
impede your recovery. Therefore, the things to avoid while fever are large
pieces of cakes or hot jalebis, even if you experience a sweet craving. These
are the avoid in fever diet.

Nutrient content is lower in processed foods. Whole, nourishing nutrients are
therefore essential to bolstering the body’s natural healing processes.

#### **Stay hydrated in Fever**

Fever is a symptom of numerous illnesses rather than a distinct illness. A
fever can also have several negative repercussions, such as dehydration, which
can worsen the body’s condition.

Even though a fever might be uncomfortable, it is a sign that the body is
battling an infection or illness. As a natural line of defense, our immune
system raises a fever to ward against infection. Although children frequently
have greater body temperatures than adults, the average human temperature is
98.6 degrees.

_The Significance of Water_

Your fever will remove essential water from the cells if you have one.
Maintaining the flow of bodily fluids is crucial for this reason. You may be
losing unusual amounts of fluid if you are vomiting, having diarrhea, or
sweating a lot. You must drink extra water to refill the body if you
experience these symptoms, which can cause dangerously high levels of
dehydration.

“Fever! A time when the body temperature is high, but still, we feel cold”

I’m suffering from fever – One of the major reasons for most of the sick
leaves by employees. It is also a symptom of underlying health issues.

At present scenario, if an individual is down with fever, he/she seems to be
scary, as it may be one of the symptoms of COVID-19. Now it is utmost
important for all to understand the diagnosis, causes and dietary management
during fever.

Fever is a very common problem from which almost all of us suffer whenever
there is a change of season. It is a defense mechanism of the body to fight
any infections.

It is a sign that our body is working against the infection which is caused by
the virus or bacteria. Diet also plays a very important role in management of
fever.

## Are you sure you are down with fever?

Fever is an illness accompanied by increased temperature, usually associated
with chilled sensations and restlessness. During fever, the temperature is at
or above on of these levels.

  * 100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)
  * 99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)
  * 99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)

## Are you aware of the causes?

Fever occurs when an area in your brain called the hypothalamus— also known as
your body’s “thermostat” — shifts the set point of the normal body temperature
upward. You may shiver to generate more body heat, eventually resulting in an
elevated body temperature.

Elevated body temperature accompanied with sweating, shivering, appetite loss,
dehydration, weakness and headache might be caused by:

  * Virus & bacterial infection
  * Heat exhaustion
  * Extreme sunburn
  * Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis — inflammation of the lining of your joints
  * A malignant tumour

Fever is not a disease, but a sign of any infection or inflammation. Some of
the metabolic effects of fever are;

  * Increase in the BMR which is almost 7% for every degree rise in temperature.
  * Decreased glycogen stores from the adipose tissue.
  * Increased breakdown of proteins due to infection.
  * Accelerated loss of body fluids owing to increased perspiration and excretion of wastes.
  * Increased excretion of sodium and potassium.

## Following are some tips to follow when you are down with fever.

### Nutri-nibbles for Fever Management:

  1. The diet should be more of fluid given at frequent intervals during the first few days of fever. The fluid intake must be liberal to compensate for the losses from the sweat and to permit adequate volume of urine for excreting the wastes and also to maintain the electrolyte balance.
  2. The body loses a lot of fluids through perspiration and excretory wastes. This lost water-content should be replenished by consuming plenty of water. The portions should be small and as frequent as 6-8 servings per day.

__Tip:__ Herbal teas such as tulsi/mint/peppermint tea, soups liquid porridges
are preferred during fevers as it has anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory
properties.

  1. Readily digestible bland food must be included for better digestion with rapid absorption. Depending on the patient\'s need, the food can be soft or normal consistency.

__Tip:_ _Khichidis, idlis, porridges (oats, rava, rice or ragi) and homemade
soups contain essential vitamins and nutrients. Take diluted fruit juices
(unsweetened) during the fevers to boost the immunity.

  1. Protein intake must also be increased due to the increased loss of tissue proteins during fever.

__Tip:__ High quality proteins such as milk (low fat), egg, and moong
dhal/mashed dal porridge.

  1. Include dry fruits and nuts and decrease the sugar intake. As immune functions get slower in the presence of excess sugar.

  1. For quick recovery, the diet usually prescribed is high calorie, high protein, low fat and light fluid diet.

__Tip:_ _Initially the interval of feeding should be 2 hours. Later, on
improvement, it can be made into 4 hours interval or 4 meals a day. Ensure
that the patient is given fresh, hot, homemade food.

  1. In order to battle the ailment, a high protein diet supplying 1.25-1.5g protein/kg of body weight should be consumed. Protein supplements can be incorporated in the form of liquids. Sufficient intake of vitamins, sodium, and potassium (micronutrients) is necessary.

__Tip:__ Fish is an excellent source of protein. It also contains omega-3
fatty acids and vitamin D, which fight inflammation and boost immune function.

##  Wrapping up!

Fever increases the energy demand of the body. Also, during an infection,
fewer nutrients are absorbed from food.

  * Make sure to take proper rest.
  * Take a sponge bath with room temperature – cool water to bring the fever down and make them feel comfortable.
  * For prolonged fever, consult the doctor immediately.
